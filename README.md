# Forest-Smoke-and-Tree-cut-down-alert-IOT

The project develops an IoT system that detects forest fires and illegal logging activities. It uses sensors to detect smoke and changes in tree orientation, triggering alerts to users through a web interface, email, and mobile notifications. The system can prevent environmental damage and protect ecosystems by providing real-time updates on potential dangers.
